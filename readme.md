## Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning system capable of automatically detecting anomaly events, such as shoplifting, arrests, and assaults, in surveillance videos. Automatically identifying abnormal events or behaviors in video data is crucial for maintaining security, safety, and operational efficiency across diverse environments, including surveillance systems, industrial facilities, transportation networks, and healthcare facilities.

The motivation for this project lies in exploring and harnessing deep learning-based approaches for anomaly detection in videos. By leveraging the power of deep learning architectures, specifically Convolutional 3D (C3D) and MobileNet V2, this project aims to develop a robust and scalable solution for detecting anomalies in dynamic video environments.
